# TODO
* Add edge types (structure or request/provide)
* Fix overwriting dictionaries. For sure in technologies (maybe in Nodes) multiple service requested rows are being 
combined into one, with the later instance overwriting the first instance. 
* Build debugging functionality to run the model description through prior to submitting to the model stages. Warn of
things such as mismatching Node names and branch placement. Nodes with the same name existing with slightly different
branch structure, etc.
