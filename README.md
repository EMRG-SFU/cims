# CIMS
CIMS is a Python package providing the Python implementation of the [CIMS](https://pics.uvic.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/CIMS%20Community%20Excel%20model%20user%20documentation_0.pdf)
economic climate model. 

# CIMS Background
CIMS is a simulation model for economy, energy and materials. The goal of CIMS 
is to understand the relationship between energy policy and firms/households 
behaviour w.r.t. tech acquisition and use. Ultimately, CIMS has been designed to 
help policymakers make decisions (descriptive rather than normative). 

CIMS provides information such as:   
* how/what policy changes can lead to specific political objectives
* explicit and implicit costs of specific policies
* development of a model/simulation with uncertainty quantification about the 
  inputs
* energy flows through economic system, from production to individual technology 
  use (global and local)
* useful to model policy on energy efficiency, greenhouse gas and air quality
* fuel consumption, emission estimates approximated by economic activity


## Installation
Check out the [installation guide](docs/Installation.md) to get CIMS running
on your own machine. This guide will walk through downloading pre-requisites and
installing the CIMS repository from our git repository. 

## Usage
Once CIMS has been installed, follow our [introduction tutorial](tutorials/Quickstart.ipynb) to 
familiarize yourself with CIMS's key functionality.
