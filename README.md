# CIMS
CIMS is a Python package providing the Python implementation of the [CIMS](https://pics.uvic.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/CIMS%20Community%20Excel%20model%20user%20documentation_0.pdf)
economic climate model. 

Written for Dr. Bradford Griffin by developers from Simon Fraser
University's Big Data Initiative and Research Computing Group. Major
contributions have been made by Jillian Anderson, Rashid Barket, Maude Lachaine,
Adriena Wong, Kacy Wu, Daisy Yu, and Dr. Steven Bergner. 

# CIMS Background
CIMS is a simulation model for economy, energy and materials. The goal of CIMS 
is to understand the relationship between energy policy and firms/households 
behaviour w.r.t. tech acquisition and use. Ultimately, CIMS has been designed to 
help policymakers make decisions (descriptive rather than normative). 

CIMS provides information such as:   
* how/what policy changes can lead to specific political objectives
* explicit and implicit costs of specific policies
* development of a model/simulation with uncertainty quantification about the 
  inputs
* energy flows through economic system, from production to individual technology 
  use (global and local)
* useful to model policy on energy efficiency, greenhouse gas and air quality
* fuel consumption, emission estimates approximated by economic activity


## Installation
Check out the [installation guide](docs/Installation.md) to get CIMS running
on your own machine. This guide will walk through downloading pre-requisites and
installing the CIMS repository from our git repository. 

## Usage
Once CIMS has been installed, follow our [introduction tutorial](tutorials/Quickstart.ipynb) to 
familiarize yourself with CIMS's key functionality.
