## Models
Due to their large file size, models are not stored in this repository. Instead,
they are located in the `cims-models` 
[repository](https://github.com/EMRG-SFU/cims-models).

The simplest way to access these models is by using the `CIMS.download()`
function to find and download a set of compatible models. The following model's
are available through this download interface.


| Model Name   | Description                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all_models` | Contains all models from the `main` branch of the `cims-models` repository. |
|              |                                                                             |
