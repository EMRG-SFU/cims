Qs:
- Is there data/values/anything associated with things above tech level?
- What 'owns' the computation, what the computation work on, how does the computation works. Do techs with the same name have the same
Do we know something about the attribute schema based on the tech name

What needs to 'contain' data? Do Sector, or Region conrtain data or are just labels?

- (what about elasticity?)






classes:

- contains the whole thing

- tech class:
  at least 3 fields (region, sector, end use)
  name of tech
  contains a dictionary of attributes


- may need classes for types of attributes


formula classes: figure out how to map the formulas to the things we have


- write container class, takes as a constructor the json file
